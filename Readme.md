# Jekyll Blog

## Simple
No more databases, comment moderation, or pesky updates to installâ€”just your content.

## Static
Markdown, Liquid, HTML & CSS go in. Static sites come out ready for deployment.

## Blog-aware
Permalinks, categories, pages, posts, and custom layouts are all first-class citizens here.
